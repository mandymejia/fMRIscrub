`fMRIscrub` is a collection of routines for data-driven scrubbing (projection scrubbing and DVARS), motion scrubbing, and other fMRI denoising strategies such as anatomical CompCor, detrending, and nuisance regression. Projection scrubbing is also applicable to other outlier detection tasks involving high-dimensional data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fMRIscrub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mandymejia/fMRIscrub")
```

## Quick start guide

``` r
s_Dat1 <- scrub(Dat1)
plot(s_Dat1)
Dat1_cleaned <- Dat1[!s_Dat1$outlier_flag,]
```

## Data

Two scans from the [ABIDE I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) are included in `fMRIscrub`: `Dat1` has many artifacts whereas `Dat2` has few visible artifacts. Both are vectorized sagittal slices stored as numeric matrices. They are loaded into the environment upon loading the package.

We acknowledge the corresponding funding for the ABIDE I data:
